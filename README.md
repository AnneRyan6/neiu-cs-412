##**Claremont Farms Recipe Share**

Claremont is a web app for storing and searching recipes.

Purpose: I have a large garden, six chickens, and two beehives, just about two miles east of NEIU on Claremont Ave. I use my produce, eggs, and honey all the time when I cook. People are always asking me for recipes, so I'd like to create an app with three components:

1. A place to store recipes, either as text, links, pdfs, or even jpg files, since the recipes are in all of those formats.

2. The ability to add keywords or "key ingredient" search fields.

3. Third, users (including myself) could search for the recipes by specific ingredients.

Users would be able to log in, search, and retrieve recipes which would make my life easier. I would not have to search for recipes and email them each time someone asks me for one.

*Eventually I would be interested in expanding this app so friends could store their own recipes and we could share them. Other functionality could also be added later that would make it possible to scale the size of recipes up or down or even create shopping lists.*
